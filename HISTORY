  1.2.0
    - fixes to docs
    - added license
    - factored out job running logic into job.run(), for testing
    - added some specs.  gasp.

  1.0.3
    - env wasn't properly unpacked by runner, added YAML.load(job.env), thanks
      Chris Wanstrath  
    - made operations that generate migrations, etc, verbose - they dump
      stdout and stderr to console when running

  1.0.2:
    - Bj now (should) auto detect the correct rake command on windows as
      "rake.bat" not "rake".  see Bj.which_rake and Bj.rake for impl.

  1.0.1:
    - fixed name collision with 'record.attributes = hash' ar mass
      assignment method (thx jon guymon)
    - added new sponsor: http://igicom.com/

  0.0.5:
    - use full path to ruby for plugin mode
    - plugin correctly installs bin -->> script
    - plugin install uses --force
    - properly quote paths in windows (spaces)
    - switch win signal to ABRT (was INT)
    - background job regrestration now uses ppid to pin the subprocess to a
      parent
    - use ppid to detect parent death and exit in event loop 
    - don't use gem dependanices in plugin as they are broken when loading from
      muliple gem repos
    - added a small amount of drb magic that allows signals to work across
      processes even on windows (see http://drawohara.com/post/22540307)
  
0.0.4:
  - basic functionality in windows
  - several small bug fixes

0.0.3:
  - *many* small bug fixes

  - plugin install should now pick up dependancies from plugin dir, last
    release had LOAD_PATH/gem issues and was picking up globally installed
    gems

  - automatic management of the background processing can be turned off if you
    want to manage your own processes 

  - all jobs are automatically restartable unless submitted with 

       :restartable => false

    this means that, should a runner ever die, upon restart any jobs that were
    mid-process will automatically be restarted

  - signal based parent lifeline move out of thread and into even loop

  - :lock => true added to a few AR finds to support true write serializable
    transaction isolation when the db supports it

  - all migrations now use :force => true and

  - running 'bj setup' will always generate a new migration, even if you've
    already run it before.  this allows easy version upgrades.

  - a few command would blow up on windows because they weren't prefixed with
    'ruby'.  gotta love the lack of #shebang line on windoze...

  - ./script/bj is searched first before system path env var

  - a default PATH is provided for whacky systems without one

  - database.yml is filtered through ERB ala rails
  
0.0.2:
  - path bug fixes

0.0.1:
  - initial release
