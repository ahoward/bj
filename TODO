- fix TZ bug

- fix doc bug regarding runners

- crontab option

- make tickle easier

- eval option

- flesh out the cli interface - it's a test only at this point

- commands need quoting, esp for windows, "c:\Documents And..." etc




- the whole gem_path thing is still fubar

- signals not operating properly on windows , non critical error tho...

- need to figure out how to cache connections for Bj.in(...)

- ttl will be added. maxing it out will cause auto-resubmission (Steve Midgley)

- is having the runner thread try forever to start the process the best thing?

- allow easy way to run ruby code.  perhaps ./script/runner 'eval STDIN.read'
  is good enough

- allow easy way to run ruby code that persists

- allow specification of runner on submit (--runner)

- allow specification of tags a runner will consume (--tag)

- test in windows

================================================================================

X ./script/console submission hangs on windows
X default PATH setting
X install issues for dave? - gem_path...
X main only loaded for (bin|script)/bj
X make it possible to declare externally managed runners
X restartable will be added. true by default (Steve Midgley)
X do the lifeline inline with the loop
X need to address the serialzable writer issue (:lock => true ??)
X migrations use --force
X i forget to add "#{ Bj.ruby } ... " to the generate command
X ./script/bj must be found in path before c:/.....bin/bj
X make sure database.yml is loaded via YAML::load(ERB.new(File.read * "config/database.yml").result)
