DESCRIPTION
  ________________________________
  Overview
  --------------------------------
  
  Backgroundjob (Bj) is a brain dead simple, zero admin, background priority
  queue for Rails.  Bj is robust, platform independent (including winblows),
  and supports internal or external manangement of the background runner
  process.
  
  Jobs can be submitted to the queue directly using the api or from the command
  line using the ./script/bj:
  
    api:
      Bj.submit 'cat /etc/password'
  
    command line:
      bj submit cat /etc/password
  
  Bj's priority queue lives in the database and is therefore durable - your
  jobs will live across an app crash or machine reboot.  The job management is
  comprehensive - capturing stdout, stderr, exit_status, and temporal
  statistics about each job:
  
    jobs =
      Bj.submit command_or_array_of_commands, :priority => 42
  
    ...
  
    jobs.each do |job|
      if job.finished?
        p job.stdout
        p job.stderr
        p job.exit_status
        p job.started_at
        p job.finished_at
      end
    end
  
  In addition the background runner process logs all commands run and their
  exit_status to a log named using the following convention:
  
    rails_root/log/bj.#{ HOSTNAME }.#{ RAILS_ENV }.log
  
  Bj allows you to submit jobs to multiple databases; for instance, if your
  application is running in development mode you may do:
  
    Bj.in :production do
      Bj.submit 'my_job.exe'
    end
  
  Bj manages the ever growing list of jobs ran by automatically archiving them
  into another table (by default jobs > 24 hrs old are archived) to prevent the
  jobs table from becoming bloated and huge.
  
  All Bj's tables are namespaced and accessible via the Bj module:
  
    Bj.table.job.find(:all)         # jobs table
    Bj.table.job_archive.find(:all) # archived jobs
    Bj.table.config.find(:all)      # configuration and runner state
  
  Bj always arranges for submitted jobs to run with a current working
  directory of RAILS_ROOT and with the correct RAILS_ENV setting.  For
  example, if you submit a job in production it will have ENV['RAILS_ENV'] ==
  'production' when the job is ran.
  
  When Bj manages the background runner it will never outlive the rails
  application - it is started and stopped on demand in parallel with the rails
  app parent process.  This is also true for ./script/console - Bj will
  automatically fire off the background runner to process jobs submitted using
  the console iff needed.
  
  Bj starts *one process per server*.  For instance, if you are running 3
  mongrels via mongrel cluster Bj will automatically fire up *one background
  process* per mongrel.  This helps you scale background processes in a
  relatively POLS fashion, but note that the number of background runners does
  not *really* determine throughput - that is determined primarily by the
  nature of the jobs themselves and how much work they perform per process,
  though having more background processes can also help.
  
  
  ________________________________
  Architecture
  --------------------------------
  
  If one ignores platform specific details the design of Bj is quite simple: the
  main Rails application submits jobs to table, stored in the database.  The act
  of submitting triggers exactly one of two things to occur:
  
    1) a new long running background runner to be started
  
    2) an existing background runner to be signaled
  
  The background runner refuses to run two copies of itself for a given
  hostname/rails_env combination.  For example you may only have one background
  runner processing jobs on localhost in development mode.
  
  The background runner, under normal circumstances, is managed by Bj itself -
  you need do nothing to start, monitor, or stop it - it just works.  However,
  some people will prefer manage their own background process, see 'External
  Runner' section below for more on this.
  
  The runner simply processes each job in a highest priority oldest-in fashion,
  capturing stdout, stderr, exit_status, etc. and storing the information back
  into the database while logging it's actions.  When there are no jobs to run
  the runner goes to sleep for 42 seconds; however this sleep is interuptable,
  such as when the runner is signaled that a new job has been submitted so,
  under normal circumstances there will be zero lag between job submission and
  job running for an empty queue.
  
  
  ________________________________
  External Runner / Clustering
  --------------------------------
  
  For the paranoid control freaks out there (myself included) it is quite
  possible to manage and monitor the runner process manually.  This can be
  desirable in production setups where monitoring software may kill leaking
  rails apps periodically or in any case where you want to montior and control
  the background process directly.
  
  Recalling that Bj will only allow one copy of itself to process jobs per
  hostname/rails_env pair we can simply do something like this in cron
  
    cmd = bj run --forever \
                 --rails_env=development \
                 --rails_root=/Users/ahoward/rails_root
  
    */15 * * * * $cmd 
  
  this will simply attempt the start the background runner every 15 minutes if,
  and only if, it's not *already* running.
  
  In addtion to this you'll want to tell Bj not to manage the runner itself
  using
  
    Bj.config["production.no_tickle"] = true

  For instance in ./config/initializer/bj.rb or ./config/environment.rb.
  
  Note that, for clusting setups, it's as simple as adding a crontab and
  config entry like this for each host you app is running on.  Because Bj
  throttles background runners per hostname this will allow one runner per
  hostname - making it quite simple to cluster three nodes behind a besieged
  rails application.
  
  
  ________________________________
  Designing Jobs
  --------------------------------
  
  Bj runs it's jobs as command line applications.  It ensures that all jobs run
  in RAILS_ROOT so it's quite natural to apply a pattern such as
  
    mkdir ./jobs
    edit ./jobs/background_job_to_run
  
    ...
  
    Bj.submit "./jobs/background_job_to_run"
  
  If you need to run you jobs under an entire rails environment you'll need to
  do this:
  
    Bj.submit "./script/runner ./jobs/background_job_to_run"
  
  Obviously "./script/runner" loads the rails environment for you.  It's worth
  noting that this happens for each job and that this is by design: the reason
  is that most rails applications leak memory like a sieve so, if one were to
  spawn a long running process that used the application code base you'd have a
  lovely doubling of memory usage on you app servers.  Although loading the
  rails environment for each background job requires a little time, a little
  cpu, and a lot less memory.  A future version of Bj will provide a way to load
  the rails environment once and to process background jobs in this environment,
  but anyone wanting to use this in production will be required to duct tape
  their entire chest and have a team of oxen rip off the tape without screaming
  to prove steelyness of spirit and profound understanding of the other side.
  
  Don't forget that you can submit jobs with command line arguments:
  
    Bj.submit "./jobs/a.rb 1 foobar --force" 
  
  and that you can do powerful things by passing stdin to a job that powers
  through a list of work.  For instance, assume a "./jobs/bulkmail" job
  resembling
  
    STDIN.each do |line|
      address = line.strip
      mail_message_to address
    end
    
  then you could
  
    stdin = [
      "foo@bar.com",
      "bar@foo.com",
      "ara.t.howard@codeforpeople.com",
    ]
  
    Bj.submit "./script/runner ./jobs/bulkmail", :stdin => stdin
  
  and all those emails would be sent in the background.
  
  Bj's power is putting jobs in the background in a simple and robust fashion.
  It's your task to build intelligent jobs that leverage batch processing, and
  other, possibilities.  The upshot of building tasks this way is that they are
  quite easy to test before submitting them from inside your application.

  Install 
  --------------------------------
    
    Bj can be installed two ways: as a plugin or via rubygems
  
      plugin:
        1) ./script/plugin install http://codeforpeople.rubyforge.org/svn/rails/plugins/bj
        2) ./script/bj setup
  
      gem:
        1) $sudo gem install bj
        2) add "require 'bj'" to config/environment.rb
        3) bj setup
  
  ________________________________
  Api
  --------------------------------
  
  submit jobs for background processing.  'jobs' can be a string or array of
  strings.  options are applied to each job in the 'jobs', and the list of
  submitted jobs is always returned.  options (string or symbol) can be
    
    :rails_env => production|development|key_in_database_yml 
                  when given this keyword causes bj to submit jobs to the
                  specified database.  default is RAILS_ENV.
  
    :priority => any number, including negative ones.  default is zero.
  
    :tag => a tag added to the job.  simply makes searching easier.
  
    :env => a hash specifying any additional environment vars the background
            process should have.
  
    :stdin => any stdin the background process should have.  must respond_to
              to_s
    
  eg:
  
    jobs = Bj.submit 'echo foobar', :tag => 'simple job'
  
    jobs = Bj.submit '/bin/cat', :stdin => 'in the hat', :priority => 42
  
    jobs = Bj.submit './script/runner ./scripts/a.rb', :rails_env => 'production'
  
    jobs = Bj.submit './script/runner /dev/stdin',
                     :stdin => 'p RAILS_ENV',
                     :tag => 'dynamic ruby code'
  
    jobs Bj.submit array_of_commands, :priority => 451 
    
  when jobs are run, they are run in RAILS_ROOT.  various attributes are
  available *only* once the job has finished.  you can check whether or not a
  job is finished by using the #finished method, which simple does a reload and
  checks to see if the exit_status is non-nil.
    
    eg:
    
      jobs = Bj.submit list_of_jobs, :tag => 'important'
      ...
      
      jobs.each do |job|
        if job.finished?
          p job.exit_status
          p job.stdout
          p job.stderr
        end
      end
  
  See lib/bj/api.rb for more details.
